Haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return functions as
return values.

A function that does either of those is called a higher order function.

Higher order functions aren't just a part of the Haskell experience, they
pretty much are the Haskell experience.

It turns out that if you want to define computations by defining what stuff
*is* instead of defining steps that change some state and maybe looping them,
higher order functions are indispensable.

They're a really powerful way of solving problems and thinking about programs.
